# DevSecOps Pipeline on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview

This repository implements a comprehensive DevSecOps pipeline for deploying applications to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) following Microsoft's recommended architecture patterns. The implementation emphasizes security-first approach, automated testing, and continuous monitoring throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Architecture

The solution follows the **DevSecOps on Azure Kubernetes Service** architecture pattern as outlined in the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/devsecops/devsecops-on-aks).

### Key Components

- **Source Control**: GitHub with branch protection policies
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with security-integrated workflows
- **Container Registry**: Azure Container Registry (ACR) with image scanning
- **Orchestration**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **Security**: Microsoft Defender for Cloud integration
- **Infrastructure**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using ARM/Bicep templates

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Container Platform** | Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) | Container orchestration |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Automated build and deployment |
| **Container Registry** | Azure Container Registry (ACR) | Secure container image storage |
| **Security Scanning** | Microsoft Defender for Cloud | Vulnerability assessment |
| **Infrastructure** | ARM Templates/Bicep | Infrastructure as Code |

## Security Implementation

### Security-First Approach

This implementation follows the **shift-left security** principle, integrating security checks throughout the development lifecycle:

1. **Source Code Security**
   - GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) enabled
   - CodeQL analysis for vulnerability detection
   - Dependabot for dependency vulnerability management
   - Branch protection rules with required reviews

2. **Container Security**
   - Base image vulnerability scanning
   - Runtime security monitoring

3. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Microsoft Defender for Cloud integration
   - Azure Policy compliance checking
   - Resource access controls with Azure RBAC
   - Audit logging and monitoring

### Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- GitHub account with Actions enabled
- Docker installed locally
- kubectl configured for AKS access
- Azure CLI installed and configured

## Best Practices Implemented

### DevSecOps Principles

- **Shift-Left Security**: Security integrated from development start
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security and performance monitoring
- **Automated Compliance**: Policy-as-code implementation
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Infrastructure as Code practices
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Least privilege access controls
